<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I built this project out of a passion for finding better ways to satisfy curiosity. I know when I was younger I had countless questions go unanswered. Kids deserve to be heard and get high quality, correct answers. But that being said, the internet can be a dangerous place for children. I built this as something parents could trust to give appropriate information, and invoke a sense of wonder and imagination, all well educating. . The ability to incorporate custom individualized aspects to each user's story really shows the potential of these generative technologies.
